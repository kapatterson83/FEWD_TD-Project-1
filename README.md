- Project includes index.html:
  - Changed placeholder text and added additional text.

  - Changed multiple CSS style properties throughout.

- Created experience.html and gallery.html pages along with links to those pages.

- Project includes a new profile image:
  - New profile image is 385KB (less than 400KB).
  - "profile-image" class is still attached to profile img tag.
  - Updated new profile image's alt attribute.
  - Changed multiple CSS style properties.

- Project includes a new background image:
  - New background image is in place, and the image file size is 206KB (less than 1MB).

- Edited the href value of the Home link to navigate to index.html.
